# dtTracker

A program designed as a tool to track stats and simplify rolling for the Cyberpunk 2020 TRPG ruleset, it has support for multiple ammo types, regular and called shots, full auto, and supports cyberlimb SDPs. It allows for multiple profiles to store multiple characters for different people using Firebase Authentication. My group uses a heavily modified ruleset and equipment list compared to base 2020, so be aware that a lot of the damage ordering and ammo type effects likely differ from the core ruleset.
